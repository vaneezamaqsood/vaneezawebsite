# How to Add Your Work Images

## Quick Steps:

1. **Navigate to the public folder** (should already be open):
   ```
   /Users/Simal/Desktop/Portfolio WebApp/vaneeza/public
   ```

2. **Copy your images** from Downloads or wherever you have them

3. **Rename them** to:
   - work1.jpg
   - work2.jpg  
   - work3.jpg
   - work4.jpg
   - work5.jpg
   - work6.jpg

4. **Make sure they're in the public folder** at:
   ```
   vaneeza/public/work1.jpg
   vaneeza/public/work2.jpg
   etc.
   ```

5. **Refresh the browser** - the hover effect should work automatically!

## Current Image Paths:
The code expects these exact filenames in the public folder:
- `/work1.jpg`
- `/work2.jpg`
- `/work3.jpg`
- `/work4.jpg`
- `/work5.jpg`
- `/work6.jpg`

Once you add them, they'll appear when visitors move their cursor over the hero section!
